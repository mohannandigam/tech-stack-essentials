# Soft Skills for Software Engineers

## Why Soft Skills Matter
- 50%+ of job is communication
- Code is read more than written
- Teams ship products, not individuals
- Career growth requires influence

## Technical Communication

### Writing Design Documents
**Structure**:
1. **Context**: Why this matters
2. **Goals**: What we're trying to achieve
3. **Non-Goals**: What we're NOT doing
4. **Proposed Solution**: The approach
5. **Alternatives Considered**: What else was evaluated
6. **Open Questions**: What needs discussion

**Tips**:
- Write for your audience (eng vs PM vs exec)
- Use diagrams (architecture, sequence, flow)
- Be concise but complete
- Get feedback early

### Code Reviews

**As Reviewer**:
- Be kind and constructive
- Explain the "why" behind feedback
- Approve trivial changes quickly
- Distinguish: suggestions vs blockers

**As Author**:
- Keep PRs small (<400 lines)
- Provide context in description
- Respond to feedback gracefully
- Don't take comments personally

**Example Good Comment**:
> "Consider using a Map here instead of filter+find. It's O(n) instead of O(n²) and more readable."

**Example Bad Comment**:
> "This is wrong. Use a Map."

### Technical Presentations
- Start with the "why"
- Use visuals (demos > slides)
- Practice beforehand
- Handle questions with grace
- Admit when you don't know

## Teamwork

### Collaboration
- Over-communicate (especially remote)
