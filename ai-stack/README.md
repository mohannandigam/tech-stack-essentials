model_a_scores = [0.85, 0.87, 0.86, 0.88, 0.85]
model_b_scores = [0.90, 0.91, 0.89, 0.92, 0.90]

# Paired t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(model_a_scores, model_b_scores)
# Deploy Model B only if p_value < 0.05 and improvement is significant
```

**Use Cases**:

### 📊 Logging & Observability Best Practices

#### 1. **Structured Logging**

- **Request IDs**: Track predictions end-to-end
- **Feature Values**: Log input features for debugging
- **Prediction Metadata**: Store confidence scores, model versions
- **Timing Metrics**: Track latency at each pipeline stage

```python
# Simple structured logging
import logging
import json

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def predict_with_logging(request_id, features, model):
    start_time = time.time()

    prediction = model.predict(features)
    latency = time.time() - start_time

    logger.info(json.dumps({
        'request_id': request_id,
        'model_version': model.version,
        'features': features.tolist(),
        'prediction': prediction.tolist(),
        'latency_ms': latency * 1000,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    }))

    return prediction
```

**Use Cases**:

- Debugging: Trace failed predictions
- Performance analysis: Identify bottlenecks
- Compliance: Audit trails for regulated industries
- Model improvement: Analyze edge cases from logs

#### 2. **Metrics & Monitoring**

- **Business Metrics**: Revenue impact, conversion rates
- **Model Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall trends over time
- **System Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Data Metrics**: Input distribution shifts, data quality scores

```python

from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

prediction_counter = Counter('ml_predictions_total', 'Total predictions')
prediction_latency = Histogram('ml_prediction_latency_seconds', 'Prediction latency')
model_accuracy = Gauge('ml_model_accuracy', 'Current model accuracy')

@prediction_latency.time()
def predict(features):
    prediction_counter.inc()
    result = model.predict(features)
    return result
```

- **Automated Retraining**: Trigger retraining when drift exceeds threshold

```python
# Simple drift detection
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

# Compare training vs production distributions
for feature in features:
    train_dist = training_data[feature]
    prod_dist = production_data[feature]

    statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(train_dist, prod_dist)

    if p_value < 0.05:
        logger.warning(f'Drift detected in {feature}: p={p_value}')
        # Trigger alert or retraining

## 🧠 Model Creation Foundations

- **Data readiness**: labeled set with drift checks, PII scrubbed, stratified train/val/test, and clear acceptance metrics (precision/recall/F1/latency).
- **Feature engineering**: start with baseline statistical features; add embeddings for text (e.g., `text-embedding-3-large`, `sentence-transformers`); keep feature store schemas versioned.
- **Training loop (sketch)**:

  ```python
  import mlflow, numpy as np
  from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

  mlflow.set_experiment("anomaly-detector")
  with mlflow.start_run():
      model = RandomForestClassifier(
          n_estimators=200,
          max_depth=12,
          class_weight="balanced_subsample",
          n_jobs=-1,
      ).fit(X_train, y_train)
      f1 = f1_score(y_val, model.predict(X_val))
      mlflow.log_metric("f1", f1)
      mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
  ```

- **Optimization**: prune features, enable vectorized batching, use quantization (`bitsandbytes`, ONNX Runtime), and distill larger chat models into smaller task-specific ones; profile GPU/CPU utilization before and after changes.

## 🔁 MLOps Paths

### Anomaly Detection Pipeline

- Ingest → validate (Great Expectations) → feature store (Feast/Hopsworks) → train → drift monitor (KS/PSI) → batch + streaming inference.
- CI gates: unit tests on feature code, contract tests on event schemas, regression suite on labeled holdout, and latency ceilings (p50/p95) under k6/Locust load.
- Deployment: containerize scorer + feature server; expose health, readiness, and `/metrics`; use canary or shadow traffic with automatic rollback on metric regression.

### Chat/RAG Pipeline

- Curate sources → chunk with semantic splitting → embed + store in vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/PGVector) with metadata filters → prompt templates with guardrails (Pydantic/Guardrails.ai) → evaluator set (answer correctness, grounding, toxicity).
- Hosting options: GPU-backed Kubernetes (node selectors + autoscaling), serverless GPU (SageMaker, Vertex, Azure AI), or lightweight CPU for distilled models.
- Load/quality testing: latency SLOs per token, hallucination rate on eval set, context hit-rate for retrieval, jailbreak red-team suite, and cost-per-1K tokens tracking.

### QA Toolkit

- **Data quality**: Great Expectations/Deequ checks baked into pipelines; fail fast on schema drift.
- **Model quality**: offline eval harness + golden conversations; contract tests for prompt/response format.
- **Ops**: chaos drills on vector DB and message bus; synthetic traffic replay; end-to-end traces via OpenTelemetry.

## 🗄️ Data Platform Playbooks

- **Snowflake**: stage raw to external tables → Snowpark for feature creation → Streams & Tasks for incremental updates → secure views for LLM retrieval; use masking policies for PII and row access policies for multi-tenant data.
- **Databricks**: Delta Live Tables for bronze/silver/gold → Unity Catalog for governance → Feature Store for sharing embeddings/numeric features → MLflow for runs and model registry promotion; enable Photon + autoscaling clusters for cost control.

## 🧪 QA at Scale (Large Data)

- Stratified sampling + adversarial cases; synthetic data to cover rare classes; replay production logs with PII redaction.
- Canary/blue-green deploys with automatic rollback on metric drift; shadow mode for new models until stability proven.
- Observability check: request tracing IDs propagated to model responses, structured logs with prompt/response hashes, dashboards for latency, error, and hallucination/ticket rates.

## ✅ Learning To-Do

- Map needs to architecture: pick microservices/event-driven/serverless from `architectures/` and align dependency checklist from `quick-reference`.
- Build a small anomaly detector: use the training sketch above, log to MLflow, add drift check, and wrap with a health-checked container.
- Build a chat/RAG demo: pick a vector DB, create an eval set, add guardrails, and measure latency vs. quality before/after distillation or quantization.
- Run platform drills: prototype Snowflake Task or Databricks DLT job that feeds a feature store table, then hook it to your inference path.
- QA practice: design a red-team/jailbreak suite for chat, and a drift + latency gate for anomaly detection; automate them in CI before deployment.

## 🧪 Testing ML Systems

### Data Quality Tests

```python
# Great Expectations example
import great_expectations as ge

def validate_training_data(df):
    """Validate data quality before training"""
    gx_df = ge.from_pandas(df)

    # Schema validation
    gx_df.expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list([
        'feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'target'
    ])

    # Data quality checks
    gx_df.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null('target')
    gx_df.expect_column_values_to_be_between('feature1', min_value=0, max_value=100)

    results = gx_df.validate()

    if not results['success']:
        raise ValueError(f"Data validation failed: {results}")

    return results

### Model Quality Tests

```python
# Unit tests for model behavior
import pytest

def test_model_predictions_shape():
    """Test model output shape"""
    model = load_model('my_model.pkl')
    X_test = np.random.rand(10, 5)

### Integration Tests

```python
def test_end_to_end_prediction():
    """Test complete prediction pipeline"""
    # 1. Load data
    raw_data = load_raw_data('test_sample.csv')

    # 2. Feature engineering

    # 5. Validate output format
    assert 'prediction' in results
    assert 'confidence' in results
    assert 0 <= results['confidence'] <= 1

## 📈 Monitoring & Drift Detection

### Data Drift Detection

```python
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset
from evidently.report import Report

def detect_data_drift(reference_data, current_data):
    """Detect if input data distribution has changed"""
    report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])

    result = report.as_dict()

    if result['metrics'][0]['result']['dataset_drift']:
        alert('Data drift detected!')

    return result

# Continuous monitoring
def monitor_predictions():
    """Monitor model performance in production"""
    # Get recent predictions and actuals
    predictions = get_recent_predictions(days=7)
    actuals = get_recent_actuals(days=7)

    # Calculate metrics
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

    accuracy = accuracy_score(actuals, predictions)
    f1 = f1_score(actuals, predictions, average='weighted')

    # Alert if below threshold
    if accuracy < 0.85:
        alert(f'Model accuracy dropped to {accuracy}')

    # Log metrics
    log_metric('model_accuracy', accuracy)
