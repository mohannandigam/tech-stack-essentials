# Learn - Software Architecture & Cloud Stack Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive learning repository! This guide is designed for software testers and developers who want to understand software architectures and cloud platforms from the ground up.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This repository provides high-level overviews and practical knowledge about:
- Modern software architecture patterns
- Development methodologies
- Major cloud platforms and their services

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### 1. Software Architectures
Learn about different architectural patterns used in modern software development:

- **[Monorepo](./architectures/monorepo/README.md)** - Single repository for multiple projects
- **[Microservices](./architectures/microservices/README.md)** - Distributed service-based architecture
- **[Serverless](./architectures/serverless/README.md)** - Function-as-a-Service architecture
- **[Event-Driven](./architectures/event-driven/README.md)** - Asynchronous event-based systems

### 2. Development Methodologies
Understand the processes and practices that guide software development:

- **[Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)](./methodologies/behaviour-driven-development/README.md)** - Collaboration-focused development approach
- **[Test-Driven Development (TDD)](./methodologies/test-driven-development/README.md)** - Test-first development methodology

### 3. Cloud Stacks
Explore the major cloud platforms and their services:

- **[AWS (Amazon Web Services)](./cloud-stacks/aws/README.md)** - Amazon's cloud platform
- **[GCP (Google Cloud Platform)](./cloud-stacks/gcp/README.md)** - Google's cloud platform
- **[Azure](./cloud-stacks/azure/README.md)** - Microsoft's cloud platform

## 🎯 For Software Testers

As a software tester, understanding these concepts will help you:
- Design better test strategies for different architectures
- Identify potential issues and edge cases early
- Collaborate more effectively with development teams
- Test cloud-native applications with confidence
- Find complex problems by understanding system design

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with the basics** - Begin with the architecture that interests you most
2. **Understand the concepts** - Read through the high-level explanations
3. **Think about testing** - Each topic includes testing considerations
4. **Build gradually** - Sample code and examples will be added over time
5. **Practice** - Try to identify how these patterns apply to your current projects

## 📖 Learning Path Recommendations

### For Complete Beginners:
1. Start with TDD and BDD methodologies
2. Learn about Monorepo (simplest architecture)
3. Progress to Microservices and Event-Driven architectures
4. Explore one cloud platform (start with AWS)

### For Those with Some Experience:
1. Compare Microservices vs Serverless architectures
2. Understand Event-Driven patterns
3. Explore all three cloud platforms
4. Deep dive into testing strategies for each architecture

## 🔄 Future Additions
